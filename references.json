The concerted action of TFs within the chromatin context enables precise temporal and spatial expression patterns. To understand how TFs control gene expression it is essential to model TF binding. TF motif information can help to interpret the exact role of individual regulatory elements, for instance to predict the functional impact of non-coding variants.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Here we present GimmeMotifs, a comprehensive computational framework for TF motif analysis. Compared to the previously published version, this release adds a whole range of new functionality and analysis methods. It now includes tools for <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> motif discovery, motif scanning and sequence analysis, motif clustering, calculation of performance metrics and visualization. Included with GimmeMotifs is a non-redundant database of clustered motifs. Compared to other motif databases, this collection of motifs shows competitive performance in discriminating bound from unbound sequences. Using our <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> motif discovery pipeline we find large differences in performance between <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> motif finders on ChIP-seq data. Using an ensemble method such as implemented in GimmeMotifs will generally result in improved motif identification compared to a single motif finder. Finally, we demonstrate <jats:italic>maelstrom</jats:italic>, a new ensemble method that enables comparative analysis of TF motifs between multiple high-throughput sequencing experiments, such as ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq. Using a collection of ~200 H3K27ac ChIP-seq data sets we identify TFs that play a role in hematopoietic differentiation and lineage commitment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>GimmeMotifs is a fully-featured and flexible framework for TF motif analysis.

This was recently achieved for a single gene by exploiting negative autoregulation by the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and bicistronic gene expression to reduce gene expression noise. We report new plasmids that use the same principles to achieve simultaneous, low-noise expression for two genes. The TetR system was moved to a compatible plasmid backbone, and a system based on the <jats:italic>lac</jats:italic> repressor (LacI) was found to also exhibit gene expression noise below the extrinsic noise limit. We characterize gene expression mean and noise across the range of induction levels for these plasmids, apply the LacI system to tune expression for single-molecule mRNA detection in two different growth conditions, and show that two plasmids can be co-transformed to independently tune expression of two different genes.</jats:p>",

Lorem ipsum may be used before final copy is available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.\nLorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a first-century BCE text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.\nVersions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word processors including Pages and Microsoft Word have since adopted Lorem ipsum as well.",
